				</aside><p>Rather than figuring out all your requirements and API schemas just to design your comps with mockup content hard-coded and server interactions faked—only to throw it all away when you go back and implement things “for real”—you can use Node.js to skip the hard-coding and produce client-side code that’s ready for beta at the end of the design stage.</p>

<p>The process looks a lot like good ol’ <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-comping-obtaining-signoff-with-mockups">designing in the browser</a>, but with more JavaScript and an additional layer:</p>

<ol>
<li>Design the layout and styling</li>
<li>Convert the markup to a JavaScript template</li>
<li>Create an initialization function</li>
<li>Create a simple Node.js server</li>
<li>Add a mockup data object to the server</li>
<li>Add server functions to serve static pages and JSON</li>
<li>Request and consume the JSON on the client</li>
</ol>

<p>Sound daunting? Don’t worry. The first step takes approximately a zillion times longer than any of the others. So if you’ve already mastered the design, you’ll find the rest of these steps more than manageable.</p>

<p>In this walkthrough, we’ll build a feature for a mock art store. If you want to follow along at home, you can clone my <a href="https://github.com/garann/coolartstore">GitHub repository</a>. (If you need help installing, see the <a href="https://github.com/garann/coolartstore/blob/master/README.md">README</a>, or just take a peek at the <a href="http://coolartstore.rs.af.cm/">live demo</a>—I’ll cover all the steps and code below.)</p>

<h2 id="section1">Creating templates</h2>

<p>Once you have a solid design and the markup to accompany it, converting it to a template you can use for all examples is more efficient than creating duplicate markup for each one. The hard part’s over; you already thought about where data points would be used in the design when you created it. With those choices fresh in your mind, go back and mark up your HTML with data in whatever template language you prefer.</p>

<p>For my example, I’m using a store selling art prints. Here’s a snippet of my initial markup:</p>

<pre id="snippet1"><code>&lt;h2&gt;Two Acrobats with a Dog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pablo Picasso&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src="img/102.jpg" alt="Two Acrobats with a Dog" class="active" /&gt;
&lt;ul class="info"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;8" x 11"&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;acid-free paper&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;suitable for matting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;span class="price"&gt;$49.99&lt;/span&gt;</code></pre>

<p>Think of your templates as places to define your requirements for both data and its formatting on the client side. If you can also reuse it for client-side rendering, that’s awesome—but that may not be relevant to your application. As long as you have good data, converting from one template language to another is trivial, so don’t agonize over which template engine to use.</p>

<p>You do need a template engine that will work in both the browser and Node.js, however. If you’re unsure, search for your template engine on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and verify that there’s a guide to installing it via <a href="https://npmjs.org/">npm</a> in the manual, as well as a minified script for use on the client. I prefer <a href="http://olado.github.io/doT/index.html">doT.js</a>, so here’s that snippet again marked up to add data using doT:</p>

<pre id="snippet2"><code>&lt;h2&gt;{{=it.title}}&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;{{=it.artist.name}}&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src="img/{{=it.id}}.jpg" alt="{{=it.title}}" class="active" /&gt;
&lt;ul class="info"&gt;
	{{~it.info :info_item}}
	&lt;li&gt;{{=info_item}}&lt;/li&gt;
	{{~}}
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;span class="price"&gt;{{=it.price}}&lt;/span&gt;</code></pre>

<p>I like to save my templates in their own directory at the same level as my JavaScript directory, so now I store that as <code>tmpl/detail.dot</code>.</p>

<h2 id="section2">Initializing the client</h2>

<p>Since we want to be able to use our templates in both Node and the browser, they need to be stored outside of the HTML and loaded and compiled when we open the page. To start, save the minified version of your template engine and add a script tag to your page to include it. Once that’s done, you can fetch the template, compile it, and then continue on with any other initialization work in your main JavaScript file. I’m using jQuery in my example, so my code looks like this:</p>

<pre id="snippet3"><code>var detailTmpl;

$.when( 
	$.get( "tmpl/detail.dot", function( tmpl ) {
		detailTmpl = doT.template( tmpl );
	}, "text" ) 
).then( init );</code></pre>

<p>That mysterious <code>init</code> function? That’s where I’ll put any interactivity I want to add to my currently static mockup. For the moment I’m only creating one interaction, so my <code>init</code> function is pretty simple:</p>

<pre id="snippet4"><code>function init() {
	$( "div.content" ).on( "click", "div.result", showDetail );
}</code></pre>

<p>This code can be made much more elegant using <a href="http://requirejs.org/">Require.js</a> with its text plugin. That’s beyond the scope of this demo, but I highly encourage it for production.</p>

<p>We’ll handle template rendering in <code>showDetail()</code>, but we have to add a server and data store before writing that function, since right now we lack any data <em>to</em> render.</p>

<h2 id="section3">Creating a server</h2>

<p>If I reload my page now and open the browser console, I get a JavaScript error. That’s because I’m trying to load my template via an XMLHttpRequest (XHR) on a page being served from the file system, in violation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy">same origin policy</a>. I can’t even check that my template works until the page is served properly (i.e., from a server).</p>

<p>To whip up a simple Node server that allows me to run my XHRs, I do a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Move all my existing assets into a new subdirectory called <code>public</code></li>
<li>Open my terminal or command line to my working directory and run <code>npm install express</code></li>
<li>Add a server.js file to the working directory</li>
</ul>

<p>We could write everything from scratch, of course, but it’s more work than is necessary for a basic server. The <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> framework provides a number of abstractions of server and application concepts. For the initial version of the server, the only one we’ll need is its ability to serve static resources. We can use it by adding four lines of code to <code>server.js</code>:</p>

<pre id="snippet5"><code>var express = require( "express" ),
	app = express();

app.use( express.static( __dirname + "/public" ) );

app.listen( 3000 );</code></pre>

<p>Once you start your server by typing <code>node server.js</code> in your open terminal or command line, you can view your page at http://localhost:3000 (adding a filename if necessary), and the error related to loading the template ought to disappear.</p>

<h2 id="section4">Adding server-side data</h2>

<p>While it’s certainly nice to be able to use XHRs, we’re creating the Node server to use it as a representation of the real server—and real servers store data. Though it’s not hard to create a data store that works with a Node server, it’s even less difficult to create one big <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide/Values,_variables,_and_literals?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide/Values,_Variables,_and_Literals%23Object_literals">object literal</a>. For a mockup, that’s all we really need. One of the goals here is to define the data objects we need to support in our new design, so the format of this object can be determined by the template we just added. For my example, I need an object structured something like this:</p>

<pre id="snippet6"><code>var products = {
	"102": {
		id: 102,
		title: "Two Acrobats with a Dog",
		artist: {
			name: "Pablo Picasso"
		},
		price: "$49.99",
		info: [
			"8\" x 11\"",
			"acid-free paper",
			"suitable for matting"
		]
	}
};</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>products</code> could just as easily be an array, but I want to be able to quickly find my products—once I have more than one in my fake data store—by ID. Aside from that little twist, the data look exactly like the content hard-coded in my original HTML. If I want to add more data, including things that might break the layout in unpredictable ways, I can just copy this structure and make substitutions. Well, almost.</p>

<h2 id="section5">Returning data from the server</h2>

<p>If you’ve dealt with other server-side frameworks, creating endpoints for XHRs might seem intimidating, but Express makes it really easy. We don’t need any special setup to define a server endpoint as a target for asynchronous requests. All we have to do is define the path on the server where we want to accept requests and a callback. The callback receives a request object (for doing things like getting passed-in data) and a response object (for defining what we return to the client). To return the data in my products object, I add a few lines of code at the bottom of server.js:</p>

<pre id="snippet7"><code>app.get( "/detail/:id", function( req, res ) {
	res.send( products[ req.params.id ] );
});

app.listen( 3000 );</code></pre>

<p>See? Easy. If I restart my server and go to http://localhost:3000/detail/102, I should see my object data. To break down what’s going on with the ID in the path, we’ve named the data at that position in the path "id" with the <code>:id</code> bit, and it then becomes available as a property of <code>req.params</code>.</p>

<p>The names and positions of parameters are up to us, and if our path were super complex, we could also use regular expressions to split out multiple pieces of data. Express also gives us the option of accepting data from the query string or from a POST. Of all the pieces we’re creating, however, the paths are the most likely to change in production, so it’s to our advantage to keep them as readable as possible.</p>

<p>Besides sending pure data to the client, we also want to be able to send rendered HTML, in case a user is linked directly to a product detail or doesn’t have JavaScript available. We might also want HTML for our own consumption via XHR, if we find that client-side rendering is slowing us down. So we add a second endpoint below the one we just created to do that:</p>

<pre id="snippet8"><code>app.get( "/product/:id", function( req, res ) {
	res.render( "detail", products[ req.params.id ] );
});</code></pre>

<p>For simplicity’s sake, and because the first path served JSON for an overlay while this provides a full page, I’ve used a different pathname, but kept the same pattern. This time, instead of the response’s send function, I use <code>render()</code>. Express provides some magic to make template rendering work out of the box, but since I’m using doT instead of Jade (the default template engine of Express), I have to do some additional setup.</p>

<p>First I have to go back to the terminal or command line, stop my Node server, and install my template engine using <code>npm install doT</code> and the consolidate module (which provides Express compatibility for a number of popular template engines) using <code>npm install consolidate</code>. Now I’ve got both of those in my <code>node_modules</code> directory and can use them in <code>server.js</code>.</p>

<p>Since doT (and probably your template engine of choice, as well) is accessed through consolidate, consolidate is the only additional module I need to require at the top of <code>server.js</code>:</p>

<pre id="snippet9"><code>var express = require( "express" ),
	app = express(),
	cons = require( "consolidate" );</code></pre>

<p>I want to continue serving some of my other pages statically, so I add my template configuration stuff below the existing <code>app.use</code> line in my code:</p>

<pre id="snippet10"><code>app.use( express.static( _dirname + "/public" ) );
app.engine( "dot", cons.dot );
app.set( "view engine", "dot" );
app.set( "views", _dirname + "/public/tmpl" );</code></pre>

<p>Those three new lines set doT (as exposed by consolidate) as the view engine, register files ending in <code>.dot</code> as templates, and tell Express to look in <code>/public/tmpl</code> for templates to use. So when Node sees <code>res.render( "detail", { ... } )</code>, it knows to expand <code>"detail"</code> to <code>/public/tmpl/detail.dot</code> and render it as a doT template. Now I can restart my server, go to http://localhost:3000/product/102, and see my template rendered statically, without creating a separate server-side file.</p>

<h2 id="section6" title="Penis">Fetching dynamic data</h2>

<p>Our template now works as a static page, but there’s still one more step to get our mockup populated with the data from the server. Remember the <code>showDetail</code> function from our main client-side script? It’s time to flesh that out.</p>

<p>In my simple example, the overlay my template will populate already exists as a hidden <code>div</code> on the main page, and it appears when the user clicks a <code>div</code> containing a summary of the content. This div has a data attribute storing the ID of the product that corresponds to the key and id property in my server-side data object. Once that click event happens and <code>showDetail()</code> is called, I just need to do this: </p>

<pre id="snippet11"><code>function showDetail( e ) {
	var id = $( this ).data( "id" );
	$.get( "detail/" + id, function( info ) {
		$( "div.detail" ).html( detailTmpl( info ) );
		$( "div.detail" ).show();
	}
}</code></pre>

<p>The path above is the same one I defined in <code>server.js</code>. If you chose a different name for yours, use that name here on the client. When I receive the data object from the server, I pass it to <code>detailTmpl()</code>, the compiled version of my template. The result of the <code>detailTmpl</code> function is the HTML to populate my overlay.</p>

<h2 id="section7">Onward</h2>

				<p>So there you have it! A mockup that mimics the interactions it will have with its production server precisely on the client, without the need for hard-coded data or temporary workarounds. Despite the simple exercise, the process I’ve outlined accomplishes a good deal of the setup necessary to create other workflows that require server interactions. For instance, I can fill my fake data store with more products and use that to render the initial page that triggers my overlay without having to revisit my mockup data, and my application will show the correct values in any view I add to it.</p>

<p>If you’d like to explore beyond just serving HTML and JSON, consider adding in <a href="http://socket.io/">Socket.io</a> to allow real-time interaction for multiple clients or Require.js to manage your assets on the client. You could also move your CSS into templates and serve different builds of your site for different browsers or devices. Your mockup can be as sophisticated and reflect as many of its production requirements as you choose. At the end, the lion’s share of your client-side code is done and ready to use.</p>

										<p>@Daniel Grocock – That’s a pretty broad question.. I think the correct answer is: probably. It really depends on what you need to do, though. It likely won’t come down to an issue of power so much as whether using Node offers an advantage for the kind of work your app is doing.</p>

	<p>@Matt Frysh – Absolutely, good call. Once you’re comfortable with generic tools and modules that fit a wide range of use cases, there’s a ton to explore to abstract away boilerplate code for more specific tasks.</p>

										<p>I was able to get the Cool Art Store site to render just fine on a unix box once I unblocked port 3000. You may want to point this out, since any decent firewall closes off all ports by default and those which are needed for some purpose have to be explicitly opened. It looks like you are using a model-view-controller framework here but without a longer introduction most of your excellent article is lost on me.

										<p>Interesting idea, but in my opinion using Node.js for a simple mockup with a handful of templates is overkill. Node.js is still a very new technology, and it has a significant learning curve for the uninitiated.</p>

	<p>The example presented in this article isn’t rocket science, and it isn’t anything that’s never been possible before now.

										<p>@Jeremy, I’m extremely grateful that Garann published these articles because otherwise I’d never have looked at node.js. My experience is that any tool that offers good mockups with the option to make those mockups a lot more complex is worth looking at and implementing. All programming languages and web-based technologies are difficult to learn. The term “mockup” can mean different things to different people, so I would say that any tool that offers a way to render and inspect the final design and its many interactions at low cost is worth investigating and working with. It is up to the user to squeeze some juice from the tool in light of his or her particular project. Garann presents a technology that is interesting to explore.</p>

										<p>@Bob Cochran – That’s a good point about ports. Thanks for adding it – I hadn’t even considered it. </p>

	<p>If you mean Express when you mention <span class="caps">MVC</span>, it definitely has much more power than what’s shown here, but it’s also a great tool for getting started. And, as you mention later, it can be extended into something much more involved, which is why I’m a fan of the framework.</p>

	<p>@Jeremy P Epstein – The two main reasons I’d choose Node for this over <span class="caps">PHP</span> would be 1) being able to share resources between the client and server, and 2) not knowing <span class="caps">PHP</span>. The latter is an annoyance I feel personally, as a former .NET and Java developer. The former, to me, is the big payoff. </p>

	<p>Especially for mocking-up (but also for production where possible) I like the <span class="caps">DRY</span>ness of not translating logic and templates for two different languages. As single-page apps become more prevalent and more logic exists on the client, this becomes more and more valuable in my non-mockup work, and starting in Node makes it really easy.</p>

	<p>You’re absolutely correct that this demo doesn’t show off Node’s real strengths in terms of what you can do when everything is async. But it’s only meant to help people unfamiliar with Node get comfortable using it. I’d love to see another more focused article on A List Apart someday talking about some of the awesome possibilities it opens up!</p>

										<p>This is the start of my 4th night of working with Node, Express, and doT. It is a big challenge for me. I downloaded the “coolartstore” code from GitHub, got the index.html page from that to render completely as a check on how correctly  I had installed Node and also whether whether there were networking issues. </p>

	<p>Then I set out to create my own page, my own template, and my own app, using coolartstore as a guide. My goal: create a doT template which can be rendered to hold the heading “Hello world from Bob”, and then move that template inside the index.html content. The name of the template is hello.dot. </p>

	<p>The template renders just fine, that is I can go to http://localhost:3000/hello and see the rendered template. Since it is just an h2 heading inside a div, it of course shows on the browser as black text on a white background. </p>

	<p>The index.html page renders just fine, too: I can go to http://localhost:3000/ and see a the page rendered very nicely in coolartstore regalia, since I reused the css. I took out all the coolartstore markup and replaced it with a line of my own, an h1 heading. Only the header and footer content shows. I can’t get the template to render inside the index.html page.</p>

	<p>I closely read this article each day. I have two printed copies of it with copious notes penned in the margins. I believe I have to load the hello.dot template into index.html using javascript that is in the script.js file from coolartstore. That must be what is escaping me. I thought Express was using some magic in app.get to cause the template to be injected into the index.html. Since I’m new to JavaScript, that is a fun challenge, too. I’m aware that the Javascript is actually using jQuery. I’m hoping to use plain old Javascript since jQuery would add more complexity to my learning curve.</p>

	<p>Tonight I’m hoping to figure out how to get my hello.dot template to work inside the index.html. Slowly I am succeeding.</p>

							<p>In any given day I can find myself reading up on a new W3C proposal, fixing an issue with our tax return, coding an add-on for our product, writing a conference presentation, building a server, creating a video tutorial, and doing front end development for one of our sites. Without clients dictating my workload I’m in the enviable position of being able to choose where to focus my efforts. However, I can’t physically do everything.</p>

							<p>Arguing for “separation of content from presentation” implies a neat division between the two. The reality, of course, is that content and form, structure and style, can never be fully separated. Anyone who’s ever written a document and played around to see the impact of different fonts, heading weights, and whitespace on the way the writing flows knows this is true. Anyone who’s ever squinted at HTML code, trying to parse text from tags, knows it too.</p>
