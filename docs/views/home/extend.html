      <h1>Customizing strap.less</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead">Customizing strap.less is best accomplished when you treat it as another dependency in your development stack. Doing so ensures future upgrades are as easy as possible while also familiarizing yourself to the intricacies of the framework.</p>

    <p>Once you've downloaded and included strap.less's CSS into your templates, you can move on to customizing the included components. To do so, create a new stylesheet (LESS, if you like, or just plain CSS) to house your customizations.</p>

    <div class="strapless-sidenote">
      <h4>Compiled or minified?</h4>
      <p>Unless you plan on reading a good chunk of the compiled CSS, go with the minified. It's the same code, just compacted. Less bandwidth is good, especially in production environments.</p>
    </div>

    <p>From there, include whatever strap.less components and HTML content you need to get your template setup. It's best to have a rough idea in mind of modifications to make and content to include, so be sure to spend a brief amount of time on that before moving on.</p>

    <h3>Customizing components</h3>
    <p>There are varying degrees to customizing components, but most fall into two camps: light customizations and complete visual overhauls. Luckily, there are plenty of examples of both.</p>
    <p>We define light customizations as mostly surface layer changes, things like a color and font changes to existing strap.less components. A great example of this is the the <a href="http://translate.twitter.com/">Twitter Translation Center</a> (coded by @mdo). Let's look at how to implement the custom button we wrote for this site, <code>.btn-ttc</code>.</p>
    <p>Instead of using the provided strap.less buttons, which only require just one class to start, <code>.btn</code>, we'll add our own modifier class, <code>.btn-ttc</code>. This will give us a slightly custom look with minimal effort.</p>
<pre><code class="html"><span class="nt">&lt;button</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"button"</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"btn btn-ttc"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Save changes<span class="nt">&lt;/button&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

  <p>In the custom stylesheet, add the following CSS:</p>

<pre><code class="css"><span class="c">/* Custom button</span>
<span class="c">-------------------------------------------------- */</span>

<span class="c">/* Override base .btn styles */</span>
<span class="c">/* Apply text and background changes to three key states: default, hover, and active (click). */</span>
<span class="nc">.btn-ttc</span><span class="o">,</span>
<span class="nc">.btn-ttc</span><span class="nd">:hover</span><span class="o">,</span>
<span class="nc">.btn-ttc</span><span class="nd">:active</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">color</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nb">white</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="k">text-shadow</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">0</span> <span class="m">-1px</span> <span class="m">0</span> <span class="n">rgba</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="m">0</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="m">25</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="k">background-color</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">#007da7</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c">/* Apply the custom-colored gradients */</span>
<span class="c">/* Note: you'll need to include all the appropriate gradients for various browsers and standards. */</span>
<span class="nc">.btn-ttc</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">background-repeat</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">repeat-x</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="k">background-image</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">linear</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">gradient</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">top</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="m">#009ED2</span> <span class="m">0</span><span class="o">%,</span> <span class="m">#007DA7</span> <span class="m">100</span><span class="o">%</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="o">...</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c">/* Set the hover state */</span>
<span class="c">/* An easy hover state is just to move the gradient up a small amount. Add other embellishments as you see fit. */</span>
<span class="nc">.btn-ttc</span><span class="nd">:hover</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">background-position</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">0</span> <span class="m">-15px</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

    <p>Customizing strap.less components takes time, but should be straightforward. <strong>Look to the source code often and duplicate the selectors you need for your modifications.</strong> Placing them after the strap.less source makes for easy overriding without complication. <strong>To recap, here's the basic workflow:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>For each element you want to customize, find its code in the compiled strap.less CSS. Copy and paste the selector for a component as-is. For instance, to customize the navbar background, just snag <code>.navbar</code>.</li>
      <li>Add all your custom CSS in a separate stylesheet using the selectors you just copied from the strap.less source. No need for prefacing with additional classes or using <code>!important</code> here.</li>
      <li>Rinse and repeat until you're happy with your customizations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Going beyond light customizations and into visual overhauls is just as straightforward as the above custom button. For a site like <a href="http://yourkarma.com/">Karma</a>, which uses strap.less as a CSS reset with heavy modifications, more extensive work is involved, but well worth it in the end.</p>

    <div class="strapless-sidenote">
      <h4>Alternate customization methods</h4>
      <p>While not recommended for folks new to strap.less, you may use one of two alternate methods for customization. The first is modifying the source .less files (making upgrades super difficult), and the second is mapping source LESS code to <a href="http://ruby.bvision.com/blog/please-stop-embedding-strap.less-classes-in-your-html">your own classes via mixins</a>. For the time being, neither options are documented here.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Removing potential bloat</h3>
    <p>Not all sites and applications need to make use of everything strap.less has to offer, especially in production environments where bandwidth literally becomes a financial issue. We encourage folks to remove whatever is unused with our <a href="http://v3.bootcss.com/docs/customizer/">Customizer</a>.</p>
    <p>Using the Customizer, simply uncheck any component, feature, or asset you don't need. Hit download and swap out the default strap.less files with these newly customized ones. You'll get vanilla strap.less, but without the features *you* deem unnecessary. All custom builds include compiled and minified versions, so use whichever works for you.</p>
